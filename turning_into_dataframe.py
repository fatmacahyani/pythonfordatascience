'''
After zipped lists together, we will convert the list of dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame with DataFrame() function from the pandas package.
'''

# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Turn list of dicts into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(list_of_dicts)

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
